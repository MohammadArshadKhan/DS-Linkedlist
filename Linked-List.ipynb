    "A linked list is a sequence of data elements, which are connected together via links. Each data element contains a connection to another data element in form of a pointer. Python does not have linked lists in its standard library. We implement the concept of linked lists using the concept of nodes. A node has two parts a data and next (appointing to which next node). A linked list is a data structure used to store a collection of a items. head data is the first element in a linked list.\n",

    "### Part1 Task 2 stack and que ADT\n",
    "reference: https://www.edureka.co/blog/stack-in-python/\n",
    "\n",
    "Define in your own words the terms:  stack ADT and queue ADT. List the key operations and support operations commonly associated with these ADTs.  For each ADT, give two real world data examples and explain them briefly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Stack ADT\n",
    "A stack is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the last-in,first-out(LIFO) priciple. A user may insert objects into a stack at any time, but mayb only access or remove the most recently inserted object that remains.\n",
    "\n",
    "reference- Note Book:Data Structures and algorithm in python.(Goodrich,Tamassia and Goldwasser).\n",
    "\n",
    "reference: Lecture notes and https://dbader.org/blog/stacks-in-python\n",
    "\n",
    "###### There are two key types of operations for Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "Push(o) – To add data into the stack. It inserts object o onto top of stack.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pop() – To remove data from the stack. Removes the top object of stack and returns it; if stack is empty an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The following support methods for Stack:\n",
    "\n",
    "size():  Returns the number of objects in stack\n",
    "\n",
    "isempty():  Return a boolean indicating if stack is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "top() or peek():  Return the top object of the stack, without removing it; if the stack is empty an error occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another real world example of stack is stack of pancakes\n",
    "Stack ADT Like a queue but single ended\n",
    "\n",
    "Stack can be implemented using either array or linked list. In our case i will implement using array (i.e. list in python).\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Real world example of Stack:\n",
    "1.Stack of dinner plates on table.\n",
    "2.Stack of Moulded chairs.\n",
    "3.Text editor usually provide undo process that also follows stack operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Queue ADT\n",
    "Another fundamental data structure is the queue. It is a close \"cousin\" of the stack,as a queue is a collection of objects that are inserted and removed according to the first-in first-out principle.That is the element can insert at anytime, but only the element that has been in the queue for the longest can be next removed.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### The queue supports two key methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. enqueue(o):  Insert object o at the rear of the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Nonedequeue():  Remove the object from the front of the queue and return it; an error occurs if the queue is empty\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Support methods for queue:\n",
    "\n",
    "size():  Return the number of objects in the queue\n",
    "\n",
    "integerisempty():  Return a boolean value that indicates whether the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "booleanfront():  Return, but DO NOT REMOVE, the front object in the queue; an error occurs if the queue is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "###### Real world example of Queue:\n",
    "1.Stores, theaters, reservation centers and the other similar process follows the queue process.\n",
